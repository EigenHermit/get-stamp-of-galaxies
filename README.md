# get-stamp-of-galaxies
## This program enables you to get the stamp of galaxies from a large FITS. The following are needed before using the program.
  ### 1. CFITSIO must be installed properly
  If not, you could try:  
  > apt-get install libcfitsio-bin  
  > make imcopy
  
  ### 2. The catalogue must be prepared  
  The catalogue need to contain, at least, the coordinates of sources and the name of FITS images.  
  We already have a demo catalogue for the user, stored at root directory of our project.  
  
  ### 3. The FITS image must be prepared.  
  For example, KiDS DR3 image can be downloaded from:  
  http://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl/DR3/access.php  
  
  In our demo, we prepare a demo FITS image, which is come from KiDS DR3.  
  The FITS image need to be stored at the dir 'demo_fits_image'.
  It could be download at:  
  http://ds.astro.rug.astro-wise.org:8000/KiDS_DR3.0_333.9_-33.1_r_sci.fits  
  or using a Microsoft drive:
